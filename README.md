# Theme Juice Shortcodes

This is a [Theme Juice](https://github.com/ezekg/theme-juice-starter) package containing commonly-used WordPress shortcodes. The majority of these are _unstyled_, and simply output raw HTML. If any of these are implemented within an application, they will need to be styled appropriately. Below you will find a list of all the shortcodes that are included within the package:

## Shortcodes
* [Dynamic `color` shortcodes](https://github.com/ezekg/theme-juice-shortcodes/blob/master/ThemeJuice/Packages/lib/colors.php)
* [Dynamic `font` shortcodes](https://github.com/ezekg/theme-juice-shortcodes/blob/master/ThemeJuice/Packages/lib/fonts.php)
* [`[accordion]`](https://github.com/ezekg/theme-juice-shortcodes/blob/master/ThemeJuice/Packages/lib/accordion.php)
* [`[bio]`](https://github.com/ezekg/theme-juice-shortcodes/blob/master/ThemeJuice/Packages/lib/bio.php)
* [`[button]`](https://github.com/ezekg/theme-juice-shortcodes/blob/master/ThemeJuice/Packages/lib/button.php)
* [`[row]`](https://github.com/ezekg/theme-juice-shortcodes/blob/master/ThemeJuice/Packages/lib/row.php)
* [`[col]`](https://github.com/ezekg/theme-juice-shortcodes/blob/master/ThemeJuice/Packages/lib/col.php)
* [`[map]`](https://github.com/ezekg/theme-juice-shortcodes/blob/master/ThemeJuice/Packages/lib/map.php)
* [`[staff]`](https://github.com/ezekg/theme-juice-shortcodes/blob/master/ThemeJuice/Packages/lib/staff.php)
* [`[video]`](https://github.com/ezekg/theme-juice-shortcodes/blob/master/ThemeJuice/Packages/lib/video.php)

## Todo
This package probably needs a good cleaning. There's a lot of _cruft_ that really shouldn't be included e.g `[staff]`, `[bio]`, `[accordion]`, ect. I'm sure there's also some shortcodes that would be nice to have that are not here.
